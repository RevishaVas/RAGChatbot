# 🏥 Hospital Reviews RAG Chatbot

An AI-powered chatbot built using **LangChain**, **Ollama**, **Gradio**, and **ChromaDB** that answers natural language questions by retrieving relevant insights from hospital review data.

---

## 📌 Use Case: AI-Powered Insight from Hospital Reviews

This chatbot is designed to help **patients**, **hospital administrators**, and **healthcare analysts**:

- 🔍 Ask **natural-language questions** over patient reviews.
- 🧠 Retrieve and summarize feedback on hospital staff, hygiene, facilities, or treatment experiences.
- 📊 Make **data-informed decisions** about care quality, staffing, or patient education.

The core idea follows a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) approach — where relevant documents are retrieved and used to ground the LLM's responses.

## ⚙️ Features

- ✅ **Ollama (local `phi` model)** — no API key or billing required
- ✅ **ChromaDB** for local vector search

## 🚀 Quickstart Guide

### ⚒️ 1. Install Ollama

Install Ollama from [https://ollama.com](https://ollama.com) and run the `phi` model:

```
ollama run phi
```
### 📦 2. Set Up Environment
```
git clone https://github.com/RevishaVas/RAGChatbot.git
cd RAGChatbot
```
```
# Create virtual environment
python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate      # On Windows

# OR
source venv/bin/activate     # On macOS/Linux
```
```
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### 📚 3. Build the Vector Database
```
python langchainIntro/createRetriever.py
```
This loads reviews.csv, splits the content, creates embeddings with phi, and stores them using ChromaDB.

### 💬 4. Launch the Web Chatbot  
```
python langchainIntro/webChatBot.py
```
Your browser will open the chatbot at:
👉 http://localhost:7860

## ❓ Example Questions to Try
"What do patients say about the staff?"

"Is the hospital safe and clean?"

"How is the experience with the doctors?"

"What reviews mention patient education?"

---
## ⚠️ Notes
Make sure Ollama is running and the phi model is available.
The .env and venv/ folders are excluded from Git.
You can extend the data with more CSV records for broader coverage.
